# Course-Assignments
N.B. This is a collection of various small homeworks/projects from the courses I have taken @ UCLA.

# Description
Within is a collection of various programs used for academic use in various languages. Below is an index of each course, as well as the programming languages utilized and any relevant topics. The code present is mostly from small homeworks (as sufficiently large projects have their own repositories). 

N.B. As with any academic code, the posting of this repository is to demonstrate the code and what I have learned, and is in no way meant to be a resource for plagiarism or cheating (copying code will only stunt your growth as a programmer anyways).
